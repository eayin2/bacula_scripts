Warning: Use with caution.

Prune redundant full media vols which are following to narrowly.

Run bacula_del_purged_vols after this script. Then the pruned files get deleted.

Example:
 F F F I F F F D F F F F F F F F
   x       x       x x x x x   x

We want a full backup every 3 weeks, so we get a list of all consecutive Full backups
and make sure to mark the Full backups, that are allowed to be deleted. Only Full backups,
which have a Full following backup are allowed to be deleted.
Then apply the even spread function and have at maximum 1 Full backup within 3 weeks.
The even spread function favors older backups.
