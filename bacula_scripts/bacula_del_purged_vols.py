""" bacula-del-purged-vols.py

Remove volumes and catalog entries for backups that have been marked 'Purged' based on the
deletion rules.

Deletion rules:
- Don't delete full if there are unpurged (=dependent, =unpruned) incrementals or diffs or less
  than four fulls.
- Don't delete diff if there are dependent incrementals or less than two diffs.
- Don't delete incremental if there are still dependent incrementals in the incremental chain.
  Latter should enforce that incremental backups within a chain are deleted all at once.
  This script will also work for remote storage daemons, provided that you setup the SSH alias
  in /root/.ssh/config with the same hostname that you defined for the "Address" (=hostname) in
  storages.conf.

Why this script?
We want to remove purged backups for disk space, scaling reason, but we don't want to delete all
backups that have been marked as 'Purged', because if you don't do backups for a very long time,
and have set 'AutoPrune = yes', plus your Retention is due, then important backups get deleted.
Also if you delete a full backup, which has been marked 'purged', but still have incremental
backups dependent on it, then you'll have a broken incremental backup chain.

Developing notes:
(1) We have to get the jobname and backup time from the volume file with bls, because purged volumes dont have any job
    entries in the catalog anymore.
(2) Notice that we use the clientname and filesetname to check a backup chain for consistency, because the jobname
    doesn't distinctively display all backups of a backup chain. Instead bacula uses all fileset and client name
    pairs.
(3) Not using paramiko in this script because we need `sudo` commands sometimes which we allowed with %nopasswd% for the
    user.

User notes:
(1) We dont want to have purged vols recycled/overwritten automatically. because it can happen
    that we dont do a backup for a very long time and then we'd overwrite purged vols that had
    old backups that would could still needed and leave us with no backups at all. Instead our
    autorm script handles when to delete purged vols.
    => Make sure to set `Recycle = No` in bacula configs.
(2) After you changed Recycle to 'No' you may still have previous volumes marked with
    'Recycle = Yes'. To make all volumes in your database afterwards non recycable use this
    query in your db backend:
    `UPDATE media SET recycle=0;`
(3) Use `DRY_RUN = True` to simulate this script.
(4) If you use an external SD, make sure to setup SSH accordingly.
    IMPORTANT! Notice that this script assumes your '~/.ssh/config' uses the exact same FQDN
    as provided in the 'Address' directive of /etc/bacula/bacula.dir.d/storages.conf for the SSH
    host alias.
(5) For copy jobs provide the unique 'mediatype' of the copy jobs storage, so that the
    script won't use the 'JobLevel' from the parsed volume. We parse with the tool `bls`
    and check if we find a hint of `bls` output in the 'PoolName' of the JobLevel.
    This implies that you have to name your volumes with the appropriate joblevel. That is
    e.g. "Full-Pool" or "my-full-pool" or "inc-copy-pool" or "incremental-copy-pool".
    This workaround is required, because bacula writes the wrong job level to the volume's
    metadata. In the catalog it's correct, just not in the volume's metadata, where it always
    claims that the joblevel is 'I' for incremental. So our script's deletion algorithm wouldn't
    work, therefore in that case we need to know the job level to decide if a volume can't be
    deleted.
(6) For remote storage daemons setup the ssh config like this for example:
      Host phpc01e.ffm01.
      Hostname phpc01e.ffm01.
      Port 22
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_phpc01_ed25519
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      User someuser
      ConnectTimeout=5
    Now also make sure that you add following commands for the SSH user in sudoers with
    NOPASSWD or just SSH to root@your.host!
      someuser ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cat /etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf
      someuser ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/timeout 0.1 bls -jv *
      someuser ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rm /mnt/path/to/your/offsite/storage/*
